{MYSQLCREATE}mysqladmin  create test_bw
Since you selected the MySQL option, you need to create a database named
"test_bw". In a default MySQL configuration, any user may create
and drop and modify test_* databases, but some administrators disable this.
  

{PGSQL}createdb test_bw
Since you selected the PostgreSQL option, you need to create a database named
"test_bw". This will only work if your administrator allowed it.
